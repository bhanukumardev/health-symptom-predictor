# ✅ FIXED: API Configuration Issue

## 🔧 **Problem Identified & Resolved**

### **Issue:**
Frontend was calling the **production Render backend** instead of **local backend**:
```
❌ https://health-symptom-predictor.onrender.com/api/... (404 Not Found)
```

### **Solution Applied:**
Changed `frontend/.env` to use **localhost**:
```
✅ VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

---

## 🚀 **What Was Fixed:**

**Before:**
```properties
VITE_API_URL=https://health-symptom-predictor.onrender.com
```

**After:**
```properties
# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT - use localhost
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For PRODUCTION - use Render backend  
# VITE_API_URL=https://health-symptom-predictor.onrender.com
```

## ✅ **Now Everything Should Work!**

### **Step 1: Refresh Your Browser**
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+R** (hard refresh)
- Or close and reopen http://localhost:3000/

### **Step 2: Test Notifications**
1. ✅ **Make 2-3 predictions** (so AI has data to analyze)
   - Go to "Predict" page
   - Select symptoms (Fever, Cough, Headache)
   - Click Submit
   - Repeat 2-3 times

2. ✅ **Generate AI Notification**
   - Click bell icon 🔔

## 🔄 **For Future Deployment:**

When you deploy to production, switch back to Render:

**Edit `frontend/.env`:**
```properties
# For PRODUCTION
VITE_API_URL=https://health-symptom-predictor.onrender.com

# For LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Then rebuild and deploy!
