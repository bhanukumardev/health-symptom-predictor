# ‚úÖ Build Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong:
The `netlify.toml` file had a double path issue:
- Base directory: `frontend/`
- Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
- Result: Netlify looked for `/frontend/frontend/dist` ‚ùå

## What I Fixed:
Updated `netlify.toml`:
- Base directory: `frontend` (no trailing slash)
- Publish directory: `dist` (relative to base)
- Result: Netlify correctly looks for `/frontend/dist` ‚úÖ

## What Happens Now:

Netlify should **automatically redeploy** since I pushed the fix to GitHub. 

### Wait 2-3 minutes, then:

1. **Refresh your Netlify deploy page** (the one showing the error)
2. **Check if new build started automatically** (should see "Building" status)
3. **Wait for build to complete** (usually 1-2 minutes)

### If Automatic Deploy Doesn't Start:

1. Go to: **Deploys** tab in Netlify
2. Click: **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait for build to complete

## Expected Build Log (Success):

```
12:XX:XX AM: Build command from netlify.toml: "npm run build"
12:XX:XX AM: Base directory: frontend
12:XX:XX AM: Publish directory: dist
12:XX:XX AM: Installing dependencies...
12:XX:XX AM: Building site...
12:XX:XX AM: ‚úì built in XXXms
12:XX:XX AM: Site is live ‚ú®
```

## After Successful Deployment:

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://your-site-name.netlify.app
```

**Then you MUST:**
1. Copy your Netlify URL
2. Go to Render dashboard
3. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable
4. Add your Netlify URL to the comma-separated list
5. Save and wait for Render to redeploy (2-3 minutes)

**The fix is deployed! Check Netlify now!** üöÄ
