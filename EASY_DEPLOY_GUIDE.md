# üöÄ Easy Deployment Guide - Netlify + Railway (100% Free)

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your Health Symptom Predictor app using:
- **Netlify** - Frontend (React) - Free Forever
- **Railway** - Backend (FastAPI) + PostgreSQL - $5 credit/month (renews monthly)

**Total Cost: $0** (Both are completely free with no credit card required)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

‚úÖ GitHub repository pushed (already done!)
‚úÖ Netlify account (sign up with GitHub)
‚úÖ Railway account (sign up with GitHub)
‚úÖ **NEW Groq API key** (rotate the old exposed key)

---

## Part 1: Deploy Backend to Railway üöÇ

### Step 1: Get a Fresh Groq API Key
1. Go to https://console.groq.com/keys
2. **Delete the old key** (it was exposed in git history)
3. **Create new key** ‚Üí Copy it

### Step 2: Create Railway Project
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"Sign up with GitHub"** (no credit card needed)
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. Choose `bhanukumardev/health-symptom-predictor`
6. Railway will detect the `railway.json` and `Procfile`

### Step 3: Add PostgreSQL Database
1. In your Railway project, click **"New"** ‚Üí **"Database"** ‚Üí **"PostgreSQL"**
2. Railway will automatically create a database and provide the `DATABASE_URL`
3. The connection string is automatically available as `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}`

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard, go to your service ‚Üí **"Variables"** tab:

```bash
# Required Environment Variables
DATABASE_URL=${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_new_groq_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-min-32-chars
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.netlify.app
PORT=8000
```

**Important:** 
- Replace `gsk_your_new_groq_api_key_here` with your NEW Groq API key
- Generate a strong SECRET_KEY (at least 32 characters)
- You'll update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` after deploying frontend (Step 8)

### Step 5: Deploy Backend
1. Railway will automatically deploy after you add the variables
2. Wait for deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Click on your service ‚Üí **"Settings"** ‚Üí Copy the **"Public Domain"**
4. Your backend URL will look like: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`
5. **Save this URL** - you'll need it for the frontend!

### Step 6: Verify Backend Deployment
Test your backend:
```bash
# Replace with your actual Railway URL
curl https://your-backend.up.railway.app/api/chat/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "chat",
  "llm_model": "llama-3.3-70b-versatile",
  "api_key_configured": true
}
```

‚úÖ **Backend deployed successfully!**

## Part 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify üåê

### Step 7: Create Netlify Site
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click **"Sign up with GitHub"** (no credit card needed)
3. Click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Import an existing project"**
4. Select **"Deploy with GitHub"**
5. Choose `bhanukumardev/health-symptom-predictor`

### Step 8: Configure Build Settings
Netlify will detect `netlify.toml` automatically, but verify:

- **Base directory:** `frontend`
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `frontend/dist`
- **Build settings:** Detected from `netlify.toml` ‚úÖ

### Step 9: Add Environment Variable
Before deploying, add the backend URL:

1. In Netlify, go to **"Site configuration"** ‚Üí **"Environment variables"**
2. Click **"Add a variable"** ‚Üí **"Add a single variable"**
3. Add:
   ```
   Key: VITE_API_URL
   Value: https://your-backend.up.railway.app
   ```
   (Use the Railway backend URL from Step 5)

### Step 10: Deploy Frontend
1. Click **"Deploy site"**
2. Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)
3. Netlify will give you a URL like: `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`
4. You can customize this later in **"Site settings"** ‚Üí **"Domain management"**

### Step 11: Update Backend CORS
Your frontend is now deployed, but the backend needs to allow requests from it:

1. Go back to **Railway** dashboard
2. Open your backend service ‚Üí **"Variables"**
3. Update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`:
   ```
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.netlify.app,http://localhost:3000
   ```
   (Replace with your actual Netlify URL, keep localhost for local development)
4. Railway will automatically redeploy

‚úÖ **Frontend deployed successfully!**

## Part 3: Initialize Database üóÑÔ∏è

### Step 12: Run Database Migrations
You need to create tables in your Railway PostgreSQL database:

**Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Run database initialization
railway run python backend/init_db.py
railway run python backend/seed_data.py
```

**Option B: Manual via Railway Dashboard**
1. Go to Railway ‚Üí Your PostgreSQL database
2. Click **"Connect"** ‚Üí Copy the connection string
3. Run locally with Railway DB:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:..."  # Paste Railway DB URL
   python init_db.py
   python seed_data.py
   ```

### Step 13: Create Admin User
Create an admin account:
```bash
railway run python backend/create_admin.py
```

Or run locally pointing to Railway DB:
```bash
cd backend
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:..."
python create_admin.py
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't connect to backend
**Problem:** CORS error or connection refused

**Solutions:**
1. Check `VITE_API_URL` in Netlify environment variables
2. Verify Railway backend is running (check deployment logs)
3. Confirm `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in Railway includes your Netlify URL
4. Make sure URLs don't have trailing slashes

### Backend deployment fails
**Problem:** Railway can't start the app

**Solutions:**
1. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is in `backend/` folder
3. Confirm all environment variables are set
4. Check that Python version is compatible (we use Python 3.10+)

### Database connection errors
**Problem:** "Could not connect to database"

**Solutions:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL database is running in Railway
2. Check `DATABASE_URL` is set correctly
3. Make sure database tables are initialized (run `init_db.py`)
4. Confirm database hasn't been stopped (Railway free tier limitation)

### API key not working
**Problem:** "GROQ_API_KEY is not configured"

**Solutions:**
1. Get a NEW Groq API key (old one was exposed)
2. Set `GROQ_API_KEY` in Railway environment variables
3. Redeploy backend after adding the key
4. Test with: `curl https://your-backend.railway.app/api/chat/health`
