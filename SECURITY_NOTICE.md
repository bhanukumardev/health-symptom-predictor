# üîí Security Notice

## API Key Exposure & Resolution

### What Happened
During the initial git commit, a Groq API key was accidentally included in several documentation files and scripts. GitHub's push protection system detected this and blocked the push.

### Actions Taken
‚úÖ **Immediate Response:**
1. Removed all hardcoded API keys from documentation files
2. Replaced exposed keys with placeholder text (`your_groq_api_key_here`)
3. Rewrote git history to remove the API key from all commits
4. Successfully pushed clean code to GitHub

### Files That Were Updated
The following files had API keys removed and replaced with placeholders:
- `BACKEND_LLM_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `COMPLETE_FIX.ps1`
- `COMPLETE_FEATURES_SUMMARY.md`
- `GROQ_API_WORKING.md`
- `HOW_TO_GET_DOSAGE_INFO.md`
- `HARD_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `GROQ_PROXIES_ERROR_FIXED.md`
- `GROQ_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md`
- `CORS_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `backend/test_dosage_display.py`
- `SERVERS_RUNNING.md`
- `START_ALL.ps1`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Rotate Your API Key

**The exposed API key should be considered compromised.**

#### How to Rotate Your Groq API Key:

1. **Visit Groq Console:** https://console.groq.com/keys
2. **Delete the old key:** `gsk_inK3o833FpoGiJukLDX0WGdyb3FY...`
3. **Generate a new key**
4. **Update your local `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   # Edit .env file
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_new_groq_api_key_here
   ```
5. **Restart your backend server**

### Best Practices Going Forward

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Store API keys in `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use `.env.example` files with placeholder values
- Use environment variables in production
- Review changes before committing (`git diff`)

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Commit `.env` files to git
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Include API keys in documentation
- Share API keys in chat logs or screenshots

### Current Security Status

‚úÖ **Protected:**
- `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` files contain only placeholders
- Git history is clean (no API keys in commits)
- GitHub repository is secure

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action Required:**
- **Rotate the exposed Groq API key immediately**
- Update your local `.env` file with the new key

### Questions?

If you have any security concerns or questions, please:
1. Check the [Security Policy](https://github.com/bhanukumardev/health-symptom-predictor/security/policy)
2. Report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories
3. Never post API keys in public issues or discussions

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Resolved - Clean git history, API key rotation required
