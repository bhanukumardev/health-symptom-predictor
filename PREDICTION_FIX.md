# Prediction Feature Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The "Failed to fetch" error on the Predict page was caused by:
1. **User not logged in** - No authentication token in localStorage
2. **Poor error handling** - The error message didn't clearly indicate the authentication issue
3. **Missing validation** - No check for token before making API calls

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in `api-config.ts`
- Added explicit check for authentication token before making requests
- Added console logging for debugging
- Improved error messages to distinguish between auth and network issues

### 2. Improved Error Messages in `Predict.tsx`
- Better error catching and display
- Specific message for network/server connection issues
- Detailed error logging to console for debugging

## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Start Both Servers
Ensure both servers are running:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 ✅
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅

### Step 2: Log In First
Before using the Predict feature, you **MUST** log in:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign In" or go to the Login page
3. Use these credentials:
   - **Email**: kumarbhanu818@gmail.com
   - **Password**: Bhanu123@

OR

   - **Email**: premlatakumari574@gmail.com  
   - **Password**: (use the password set during registration)

### Step 3: Use the Predict Feature
After logging in:
1. Go to the "Predict" page
2. Select symptoms by clicking the chips (e.g., Fever, Cough)
3. Click "Submit" button
4. The system will analyze and show predictions

## API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login (requires form data: username, password)
- `POST /api/predictions/predict` - Make prediction (requires auth token)
- `GET /api/predictions/history` - Get history (requires auth token)
- `POST /api/predictions/feedback` - Submit feedback (requires auth token)

## Authentication Flow
1. User logs in → receives JWT token
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. All API calls include token in Authorization header
4. If token invalid/missing → redirect to login page

## Error Messages You Might See

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| "Not authenticated. Please log in." | No token found | Log in first |
| "Cannot connect to server..." | Backend not running | Start backend server |
| "Unauthorized - please log in again" | Token expired | Log in again |
| "Field required" | Missing data in request | Check form fields |

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Try to access /predict or /history without logging in
3. Should redirect to /login with error message
4. Log in successfully
5. Go to /predict
6. Select symptoms and submit
7. Should see prediction results

### Backend Test:
```powershell
cd backend
& ".\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
python test_prediction_flow.py
```

## Current Status
✅ Backend running on port 8000
✅ Frontend running on port 3000  
✅ Authentication working
✅ Error handling improved
✅ Clear error messages added
✅ Redirect to login when not authenticated

## Next Steps for User
1. **Refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000
2. **Click "Sign In"** or navigate to login page
3. **Enter credentials** (see above)
4. **Navigate to Predict page**
5. **Select symptoms and submit**

The error message should now clearly tell you to log in if you're not authenticated!
