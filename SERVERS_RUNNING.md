# ✅ FIXED - Servers Now Running!

## 🎉 Status: WORKING

Your backend and frontend servers are now running in separate PowerShell windows!

---

## 📡 Server Status

✅ **Backend:** Running on http://localhost:8000  
✅ **Frontend:** Starting on http://localhost:3002  

---

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Step 1: Wait for Frontend (15-20 seconds)
The frontend needs time to compile. You'll see "VITE ready" in the frontend window when it's ready.

### Step 2: Open Browser
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3002**

### Step 3: Login
Use your credentials to login

### Step 4: Click History
Click the "History" link in the navigation bar

### Step 5: Verify Fix
You should now see:
- ✅ "Your last 0 predictions (Maximum 10 saved)"
- ✅ Info banner: "Only your last 10 predictions are saved to conserve space"
- ✅ Empty state with "Start Prediction" button
- ✅ NO MORE "Failed to fetch" error!

## 🐛 What Was Wrong?

1. **Multiple backend processes** were running on port 8000
2. **Port conflicts** caused connection refused errors
3. **File watching** in uvicorn caused reload loops

## ✅ What Was Fixed?

1. ✅ Killed all conflicting processes
2. ✅ Started clean backend server
3. ✅ Started frontend server
4. ✅ Verified backend health endpoint
5. ✅ Both servers running in separate windows

## 📋 If You Need to Restart

### Kill All Servers:
```powershell
Get-Process python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Start Backend (Terminal 1):
```powershell
cd "c:\Projects\AI Project\health-symptom-predictor\backend"
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000
```

### Start Frontend (Terminal 2):
```powershell
cd "c:\Projects\AI Project\health-symptom-predictor\frontend"
