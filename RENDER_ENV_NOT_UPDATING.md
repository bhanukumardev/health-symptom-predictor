# üö® CRITICAL: Render Environment Variable Not Updating!

## Problem Identified

The error logs show Render is still trying to connect to:
```
"db.txhohvmugqptewlvuhfn.supabase.co"  ‚Üê OLD DIRECT HOST
```

But you set the DATABASE_URL to:
```
"aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com"  ‚Üê NEW POOLER HOST
```

**This means Render didn't pick up the new DATABASE_URL value!**

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Force Render to Reload Environment

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**
   https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-d3hu4l3uibrs73b7kfb0

2. **Click "Manual Deploy"** button (top right)
   - Select "Deploy latest commit"
   - This forces Render to reload all environment variables

3. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for complete redeploy

---

### Option 2: Add Temporary Variable

1. **In Render Environment tab**
2. **Add new variable:**
   - KEY: `FORCE_REFRESH`
   - VALUE: `1`
3. **Click "Save Changes"**
4. **Wait for redeploy** (2-3 min)
5. **Delete `FORCE_REFRESH` variable**
6. **Save again**

This tricks Render into completely reloading all environment variables.

### Option 3: Verify DATABASE_URL Was Saved

1. **Go back to Environment tab**
2. **Look at DATABASE_URL value**
3. **Check if it shows:**
   - ‚úÖ Should contain: `aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler`
   - ‚ùå If it shows: `db.txhohvmugqptewlvuhfn` ‚Üí **Save didn't work!**

4. **If save didn't work:**
   - Click Edit on DATABASE_URL
   - **Delete ALL text**
   - **Paste fresh:**
     ```
     postgresql://postgres:Bhanu123%40@aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
     ```
   - **Click OUTSIDE the field** to ensure it registers
   - **Then click "Save Changes"**

## üîç How to Verify It's Fixed

After redeploy, check logs for:

‚úÖ **Should see:**
```
connection to server at "aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com"
```

‚ùå **Should NOT see:**
```
connection to server at "db.txhohvmugqptewlvuhfn.supabase.co"
```

## üìä Debugging Checklist

| Check | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| DATABASE_URL shows `pooler` in value | ‚¨ú | If no, re-save the value |
| Latest deploy time is recent | ‚¨ú | If old, trigger manual deploy |
| Logs show `pooler` in connection attempts | ‚¨ú | If no, environment not refreshed |
| No IPv6 addresses in error logs | ‚¨ú | Pooler uses IPv4 only |

## üí° Common Issue

**Render sometimes doesn't pick up environment variable changes immediately.**

The most reliable fix:
1. Verify DATABASE_URL is correct in UI
2. Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
3. Wait for complete redeploy
4. Check logs to confirm new host is being used

---

**Once you see `aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com` in the error logs (even if error), we'll know the environment variable updated correctly!**
