### Option 3: Test on Real Device

1. Find your computer's local IP:
   ```powershell
   ipconfig
   # Look for IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
   ```

2. Make sure backend allows CORS from your IP

3. On your phone/tablet, open:
   ```
   http://[YOUR-IP]:3000
   # Example: http://192.168.1.100:3000
   ```
